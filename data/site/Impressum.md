The Latin Text of the *Dodekachordon* is based on the version compiled and hosted by the [*Thesaurus Musicarum Latinarum*](https://chmtl.indiana.edu/tml/16th/GLADOD1_TEXT.html). I translated the German text myself. The TEI-encoded text is rendered in the Browser with the help of the [CETEIcean Library](https://github.com/TEIC/CETEIcean). The MEI files containing the musical examples are rendered as SVGs with the help of the [Verovio Toolkit](https://www.verovio.org).
