# Heinrich Glarean’s *Dodekachordon* Online
This is the main repository of a university project that aims at testing out various elements of digital publishing and scholarly editing, using [Heinrich Glarean’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Glarean) [*Dodekachordon*](https://imslp.org/wiki/Dodecachordon_(Glareanus,_Henricus)) as its guinea pig.
By providing a digital edition of (small parts of) a book on musical theory from the Renaissance, I hope to explore ways to uncover the intricacies of edition histories, expose elements of early modern learning, and make musical examples explorable and connectable.
In doing this, I hope to learn some tools of the trade, on both the musicological and the digital humanities side of things.
More details on what I hope to achieve and how I plan to go about it can be found in my [proposal](data/site/meta/Proposal.md). The [Impressum](data/site/meta/Impressum.md) contains a list of all the great tools and ressources I use in this project.
As this is meant to be a relatively small one-person university project with a focus on education, I do not expect it to grow huge in size. If I get a website going where I can present a couple of sample chapters in at least two languages, with annotations, additional media such as marginalia from a certain copy or images, and working musical examples, I would already be very pleased with the outcome. The chapters transcribed so far, along with their music examples, prototype commentary and any relevant images can be found [here](https://github.com/umj95/Glarean_Dodekachordon_Text).
